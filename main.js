// Faithful, you need to find the traitor in your midst. 

// There is a list of names in an array for you to choose from.

// Select the person's name from the array. Your only clue is that they have a hidden capital T in the middle of their name.


// An Example would be:   
// const players = [ 'davidL', 'monika', 'madTdy']

// Would have the answer of 'madTdy'

// If you have already banished all of the traitors, throw the error 'No traitor found' .

// Happy hunting!
